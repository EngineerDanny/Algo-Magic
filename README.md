This repository contains code snippets and notes for learning data structures and algorithms in Python.

| Data Structure | Algorithm |
| -------------- | --------- |
| Array | Sorting algorithms (e.g. bubble sort, insertion sort, selection sort, merge sort, quick sort) |
| Stack | Implementing a stack using an array or a linked list |
| Queue | Implementing a queue using an array or a linked list |
| Linked List | Reversing a linked list, finding the middle node, detecting a cycle |
| Hash Table | Implementing a hash table using an array and a hash function |
| Tree | Traversing a tree using depth-first search (DFS) or breadth-first search (BFS), finding the height of a tree, finding the lowest common ancestor of two nodes |
| Heap | Implementing a heap using an array, performing heap operations (e.g. insert, delete, extract min/max) |
| Graph | Implementing a graph using an adjacency list or matrix, finding the shortest path between two nodes using Dijkstra's or A* algorithm |

| Algorithm | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| String algorithms | Algorithms that manipulate strings, such as reversing a string, finding palindromes, finding anagrams, etc. |
| Divide and conquer | Algorithms that break down a problem into smaller subproblems, solve them recursively, and combine the solutions. Examples are merge sort, quick sort, binary search, etc. |
| Backtracking | Algorithms that explore all possible solutions by making choices and undoing them if they lead to a dead end. Examples are solving Sudoku, N-Queens problem, Knight's tour, etc. |
| Greedy algorithms | Algorithms that make the locally optimal choice at each step, hoping to find the globally optimal solution. Examples are Dijkstra's algorithm, Prim's algorithm, Kruskal's algorithm, etc. |
| Dynamic programming | Algorithms that solve complex problems by breaking them down into overlapping subproblems and storing the results of subproblems to avoid recomputation. Examples are Fibonacci sequence, Knapsack problem, Longest common subsequence, etc. |
